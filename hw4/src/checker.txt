Dear all,

The PA4 checker is available in the follows link:

eda.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~yslu/pd17/checker

Please use command line:

./checker inputfileName outputfileName

to run the checker. The checker will check whether the routing result has cycle, evaluate the number of total routed pins, and calculate the total wirelength.

There is a good news: due to the algorithm I used for checker, you no longer need to trim the duplicated or overlapped wire segments. The checker will handle them automatically. But it is always good to have a clean output!

The followings are some hints for this PA:

H1. A legal routing result should be cycle-free, single-tree, and within boundary. Please note that the definition of wire connection is different from the one for ICCAD contest. The point-to-edge and edge-to-edge connection are both treated as connections.

H2. The routing result will not be ranked unless it is legal and reaches 100% routability. The ranking factor includes wirelength and run time.

H3. There will be hidden cases for this PA. The weights of different test cases are different. Please work hard on large test cases.

If there is any question, feel free to email me!
Thank you!

BR,
Yu-Sheng
